## Outreach & Lead Generation

### Email Outreach Sequence (5-part series)

**Email 1: Problem Hook** (Day 1)
Subject: "Your app might have 47+ accessibility violations"
- Open with stat: "Accessibility lawsuits are up 300% since 2020"

### Targeting Strategy

**List 1: Venture-Backed SaaS (100-500 people)**
- Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- Filter: Funding Type = Venture-Backed
- Filter: Employee count 100-500
- Search: Recent funding (last 12 months) = higher budget
- List size: 500-1,000 companies

**List 2: Scale-ups with Compliance Pressure**
- Search keywords: "accessibility compliance", "WCAG audit"
- Companies that recently hired "Accessibility Lead" or "VP Product"
- Job postings for "Accessibility Engineer"
- List size: 200-300 companies

**List 3: Agencies & Design System Teams**
- In-house design system teams at mid-market companies
- Design agencies with 50-200 people
- List size: 100-200 companies

**List 4: Regulated Industries (Higher Budget)**
- Finance (fintech, banking, insurance)
- Healthcare (healthcare tech, patient portals)
- Government contractors
- Payroll/HR SaaS (subject to regulations)
- List size: 100-200 companies

**Total outreach target:** 1,000 companies, expecting 40-60 positive responses (4-6% open rate), 5-10 discovery calls, closing 2-3 projects.

## Lead Qualification Framework

**Use BANT** (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline):

| Signal | Yes | No |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Budget** | $5K+ allocated for accessibility | "We don't have budget" |
| **Authority** | Talks about "we" (has stakeholder buy-in) | "I'll have to ask..." (always) |
| **Need** | Mentions compliance, legal pressure, or customer complaints | Exploratory only |
| **Timeline** | "We need to start in [month]" | "We'll think about it" |

**Green flag combination:** 3+ of 4 signals → Schedule discovery call

**Red flag:** Only interested in free library, no budget conversation → Move to newsletter instead

---

## Pricing Strategy Rationale

### Service 1: Accessibility Audit ($5K-$15K)
- **Low end ($5K):** 1-2 applications, simpler tech stack
- **High end ($15K):** 3+ applications, complex patterns, custom report formats
- **Comparable market:** Professional accessibility audits run $150-300/hour × 30-50 hours = $4.5K-$15K
- **Our advantage:** B1C3 utilities + followup support included

### Service 2: Workshop ($3K-$8K)
- **Low end ($3K):** 1 half-day (3 hours) for small team (3-4 people)
- **High end ($8K):** Full 3-day workshop for 8 developers
- **Comparable market:** Technical training $100-200/person/day × 8 people × 3 days = $2.4K-$4.8K
- **Our advantage:** B1C3-specific, custom examples, follow-up code reviews

### Service 3: Custom Development ($8K-$30K+)
- **8K:** Quick utility (1 week, 1-2 utilities)
- **15K:** Medium project (3-4 weeks, 2-3 utilities)
- **30K+:** Large project (8 weeks, 4+ utilities, significant custom features)
- **Comparable market:** Custom development $100-300/hour × 200-500 hours = $20K-$150K
- **Our advantage:** Obsessive accessibility focus, B1C3 standards built in

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Outreach emails have low response rate (< 2%)  
**Mitigation:** Focus on warm intros (LinkedIn connections, referrals). Use multi-channel (email + LinkedIn InMail + Twitter)

**Risk:** Scoping projects becomes complex  
**Mitigation:** Create templated scope documents with clear inclusions/exclusions. Use fixed-price projects (not hourly)

**Risk:** Executing projects takes longer than estimated  
**Mitigation:** Set realistic timelines (2-3 week audit, not 1 week). Build buffer time. Use phased approach (Phase 1: audit, Phase 2+: remediation if customer wants)

**Risk:** Competing with large accessibility consulting firms  
**Mitigation:** Position as "lightweight + modern tech"—specialized for SaaS/startups (not huge enterprises). Leverage B1C3 utilities as unique differentiation.

---

## Resources & Tools

- **Email outreach:** Gmail + Mailchimp or Lemlist (drip campaigns)
- **Lead research:** LinkedIn Sales Navigator ($99/month)
- **CRM:** Airtable (free) or HubSpot (free tier)
- **Calendly:** Free tier (unlimited 1-on-1 meetings)
- **Documentation:** Notion or Markdown + GitHub (templates)
- **Financials:** Stripe or Square for invoicing

---

## Success Story Format

Once you close first project:
1. **During project:** Document decisions, images of code, accessibility findings
2. **After completion:** Schedule 30-min call to get quote + permission
3. **Within 1 week:** Publish on Medium, LinkedIn, and B1C3 site
4. **Promote:** Share in accessibility communities, tweet, email to warm leads

*This plan is Phase 2B (Feb-Apr 2026). Phase 3 will scale Services with additional team members and develop SaaS product offerings.*
